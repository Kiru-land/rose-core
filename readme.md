## Introduction - The Bloom

*23/07/2024*

**A New Era**

```md
Here lies a manifesto for freedom,  

A Rose, blossoms in the sky.

🌹
```

## Definition - The Garden

2024 has been a wild year on-chain.  
CORPs raising millions of dollars waiting to dump on your stupid ass to buy a mansion in beverly hills.  
One of the most profitable trades this year has been shorting worthless VC projects to zero.

A nihilistic economic paradigm emerged to challenge the established power structure.

We've witnessed the resurgence of memecoins, tokens with no pretense of intrinsic value derived from being loosely tied to a product, and custom lauch bonding curves designed for fairer coin creation.

This is a reality check for everyone. You cannot stitch a token to a product.

**In crypto, the token is the product.**

In the midst of this, a flower.

Rose is part of the new generation of cypherpunk finance, improving on the core aspects of the current state:

- **Price performance**: Rose cleverly exploits the AMM model to bind price performance to volume.
- **Fair distribution**: fairly distributed on day one, without premine, snipers or external funding.
- **Community owned**: Rose DAO is fully decentralized with no legally-binding entity, leveraging the [RWGM](#rose-dao) algorithm to democratically allocate funds.
- **Privacy preserving**: Rose supports on-chain privacy through the [Black Box](contracts/src/BlackBox.sol) privacy device, leveraging [pedersen commitments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedersen_commitment), [merkle-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) and [Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) to ensure unlinkability of transactions, with no extractable MEV.
- **Uncompromised security**: Rose settles on mainnet, where communities can access true decentralization and privacy. We don't fuck with the feds.

### the Asymmetric AMM

**Rose** implements an asymmetric bonding curve that optimizes for *price upside volatility* and *deep liquidity* on exits, **mimicking an [Asymmetric AMM](models/ContinuousModel.jl)**.

An Asymmetric AMM ($aAMM$) is a Bonding Curve with two distinct formulas for buy and sell orders.  
[Rose aAMM market implementation](contracts/src/Rose.sol) decreases liquidity on buy orders to increase upside volatility, while providing deep liquidity for sellers. As a result, for an equivalent long/short volume, the price will increase *proportionally to the volume itself*.  
**This is unlike traditional AMM bonding curves where a long/short ratio of 1 implies no price changes***  
*ignoring plateform fees

For every buy order, a skew parameter $α$ determines the quantity of the reserves to withdraw.  
A penalty is added on sell orders to incentivize long-term holding, dictated by the slash-factor $ϕ$.

</div>

*Constant-product random walk. initial reserves: (10k, 10k). The random walk is generated from a series of buy and sell orders drawn from a Laplace distribution with parameters (μ=0, θ=10), with a total volume of 100k.
The multiplicative relation is preserved:
We get the same results with reserves of (1m, 1m) and 10m in volume.*

*Asymmetric AMM random walk. initial reserves: (10k, 10k) and initial α: 0.1. Laplace parameters (μ=0, θ=10), with a total volume of 100k.*

#### α parameter

In practice, the skew parameter $α$ is dynamically adjusted using the remaining reserves to ensure it reaches an optimal spot in the tradeoff between upside volatility, slippage and total available liquidity.

</div>

*Spot price of Rose after 1b volume with variation of the α parameter. Log scale, denominated in ETH, starting at 1 with reserves (1e6, 1e6).
Volume is uniform across both buy and sell orders.*  
*reading: for 1b total volume (500m buys and 500m sells), the price mechanically increases by ~1000% for α = 0.01.*

By the constant-product formula, there is a proportional relation between the reserves liquidity and volatility for a fixed amount bought. Rose controls volatility by reducing market depth on buy orders, while preserving deep liquidity on sell orders.

*Reserve R₀ amount, uniform volume of 1b with varying α, log scale.
starting from reserves (1e6, 1e6).  
reading: for 1b total volume (500m buys and 500m sells), R₀ decreases by ~90% with α = 0.01.*

<!-- The soundness of the system stems from the fact that one can view the rose $aAMM$ as a Just-In-Time liquidity strategy on an AMM pool, JIT withdrawing part of the liquidity on buy orders, then providing back at the updated reserve ratio. -->

#### Burns and buybacks

Since a buy order is not executed on full liquidity, the reserves ratio increases faster than a classical AMM pool, thus leaving an excess of `rose` when reinjecting liquidity.  
This excess amount is removed from the reserves then burned, creating a net deflationary asset, without traditional deflation shortcomings:

*Rose's aAMM binds the asset deflation to market liquidity.*

In theory, when the monetary mass of an asset decreases, price automatically increases because the total monetary value is still the same, but distributed over less supply.  
In practice, a burn doesn't directly affect market liquidity and often does not meaningfully implies price appreciation.

the aAMM ensures mechanical price appreciation from volume by permanently removing liquidity from the market, weighted by the skew parameter $\alpha$.

A penalty on sells is added to increase the LP portfolio in the denominating asset, and is used to proceed to strategic buybacks to further support `Rose` price.

#### Under the AMM model

The soundness proof of this system stems from the fact that $aAMMs$ can be modeled within the $AMM$ model, with a $ROSE/ETH$ liquidity pool.

For the buy case:

- The liquidity provider burns $α * lp tokens$
- Swap of $x$ $token_0$ to $token_1$
- The liquidity provider mints the maximum amount of lp tokens from withdrawn reserves at the new reserves ratio

and the sell case:

- A swap (exact output) of $x$ units from $token_1$ to $token_0$ with a sell fee on $token_0$

From this we can compute and derive the price of `Rose` as a direct function of $\alpha$ and market liquidity.

### ROSE DAO

ROSE protocol is fully decentralized.

Every parameter change is automated, every action taken with the treasury is the result of decentralized coordination between community members.
Rose intends to go further than traditional DAOs and leverage its treasury to create positive externalities in the real world.

The protocol uses the Regularised Weighted Geometric Median (RWGM) algorithm to democratically allocate treasury funds.
RWGM is a robust algorithm designed to calculate the [geometric median](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02394) of a set of allocations while mitigating the impact of highly correlated actors.

we set $W_i$ as the allocation vector of staker $i$.
The geometric median guarantees an allocation inside the convex hull of the vectors $W$, ensuring limited power to strategic individuals.  
However, it's known that cabals can manipulate the geometric median, shifting the final allocation towards their preferred vector $(\neq W_i)$ by submitting more weights towards polarized dimensions.  
Adding a regularization term $λ$ to the geometric median, which penalizes correlated and polarized actors, ensures that manipulation is practically unfeasible.

This makes the Rose protocol resilient to any form of government coersion and censorship, while setting free from the chains of legacy entities.

We don't respect the CORP,

Rose is *new-money*, Rose is *PUNK money*.

## Deep Dive - The Roots

### CPMM bonding curve

We start by defining a pair of reserves $(R_0, R_1) : ℝ²$, and the Constant-product Transition Function:

$$
(R_0 + x) \cdot (R_1 - y) = K
$$

solving for y:

$$
y = R_1 - \frac{K}{R_0 + x}
$$

where:

- $K$ : the constant product $R_0 ⋅ R_1$  
- $x$ : amount of $token_0$ in/out, defined from $-R_0$ to $+∞$  
- $y$ : amount of $token_1$ out/in, defined from $-∞$ to $+∞$

From this, we derive the Constant-Product Bonding Curve $Γ : (R_0, R_1, x) -> (R_0′, R_1′, y)$:

- $R_0′ = R_0 + x$

- $R_1′ = \frac{K}{R_0 + x}$

- $y = R_1 - R_1′$

With a spot price is defined as:
$p = \frac{R_1}{R_0}$

> [!NOTE]
> All swaps are expressed in terms of $token_0$. A positive $x$ means a buy order of $y$ $token_1$ against $x$ units of $token_0$, while a negative $x$ represent a sell order of $y$ $token_1$ against $-x$ $token_0$.  

### ROSE Asymmetric Bonding Curve

In order to sustain price performance, we introduce the Skew Trading Function:

$$
y = \begin{cases}
R_1 - \frac{α^2K}{α R_0 + x} & \text{for } x > 0 \\
R_1 - \frac{K}{R_0 + (1+ϕ) \cdot x} & \text{for } x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Here,  

- $α$ is the skew parameter
- $ϕ$ is the slash parameter

We then define the Asymmetric AMM  bonding curve : $(α, R_0, R_1, x) -> (R_0′, R_1′, y)$:

$$
R_0′, R_1′, y = \begin{cases}
Γ^+(R_0, R_1, x) & \text{for } x > 0 \\
Γ^-(R_0, R_1, x) & \text{for } x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

with $Γ^+ : (R_0, R_1, x) -> (R_0′, R_1′, y)$ defined as:

- $R_0′ = R_0 + x$

- $R_1′ = \frac{αR_1}{αR_0} ⋅ R_0′$

- $y = R_1 - \frac{α^2K}{αR_0 + x}$

and $Γ^- : (R_0, R_1, x) -> (R_0′, R_1′, y)$ defined as:

- $R_0′ = R_0 - x$

- $R_1′ = \frac{K}{R_0′}$

- $y = (R_1 - R_1′) \cdot ϕ$

This asymmetry ensures that the selling pressure changes the reserve ratio more gradually compared to buying pressure.

### Asymmetric AMM : Continuous model

We then extend the discrete model to continuous time.

Let $ϕ(t)$ be the continuous slash-factor function $(0 \leq ϕ(t) \leq 1)$.

Let $x(t)$, the rate of buying (if positive) or selling (if negative)

Let the spot price $p$ be:

$$p = \frac{R_1(t)}{R_0(t)}$$

Let $α(t)$ be the continuous skew function defined for $(0 \leq α(t) < 1)$:

$$α(t) = 1 - (α(0) * \frac{R_1(t)}{R_1(0)})$$

As volume increases over time, $R_1$, the reserves of $token_1$ decreases. The ratio of reserves removed on buy orders will decrease over time.

we can now define the continuous Asymmetric AMM : $(α(t), R_0(t), R_1(t), x(t)) -> (R_0′(t), R_1′(t), y(t))$

By definition,

$$\frac{dR_0}{dt} = x(t)$$

Then,

$$
R_1(t) = \begin{cases}
\frac{α(t)R_1(t)}{α(t)R_0(t)} ⋅ (R_0(t) + x(t)) & \text{for } x(t) > 0 \\
\frac{K}{R_1(t) + x(t)} & \text{for } x(t) < 0
\end{cases}
$$

and

$$
y(t) = \begin{cases}
R_1(t) - \frac{α(t)^2K}{α(t)R_0(t) + x(t)} & \text{for } x(t) > 0 \\
R_1(t) - \frac{K}{R_1(t) + (1+ϕ)x(t)} & \text{for } x(t) < 0
\end{cases}
$$

The Asymmetric AMM introduces a mechanism exploiting a tradeoff between market liquidity, slippage and upside volatility.
